# Module 01: Introduction & Architecture

Welcome to **Build a Scale-to-Zero Rust Portfolio**. In this course, you will build a high-performance, cost-effective artist portfolio that uses a "Hybrid" architecture to pay $0/month in hosting while maintaining professional speed and security.

## What You Will Build

A dynamic content management system (CMS) where you can:
*   Create and edit Projects.
*   Upload high-res images (automatically optimized).
*   Reorder content blocks.
*   Manage your "About" and "Contact" pages.

But unlike a standard app, this one has a superpower: **The public site is Static.**

## The Architecture

We combine two hosting types to get the best of both worlds:

1.  **The Backend (Dynamic)**: Written in **Rust** (Axum). It holds your Admin Panel. It lives on **Render.com**. To save money, it "sleeps" when you aren't using it.
2.  **The Frontend (Static)**: A set of HTML files generated by Rust. It lives on **Cloudflare Pages**. It is *always* online, globally distributed, and loads instantly.

    end
```

## The Tech Stack

*   **Rust**: For speed, safety, and tooling.
*   **Axum**: The modern standard for Rust web servers.
*   **SQLx**: Type-safe database queries.
*   **Askama**: Compiles HTML templates into the binary (super fast).
*   **HTMX**: Gives us Single-Page-App feel without the complexity of React.

In the next module, we'll set up your machine to build this beast.
